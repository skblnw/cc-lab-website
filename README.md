## Routing

The site uses **hash-based routing** for GitHub Pages compatibility.

| Route | Page |
|-------|------|
| `/` | Home (Hero + Recent Posts) |
| `/#/member` | Team Members |
| `/#/publication` | Research Publications |
| `/#/news` | News & Events |
| `/#/resources` | Resources |
| `/#/contact` | Contact Information |

---

## Content Management

### Decap CMS

Access the CMS to manage content without touching code:

- **Development:** `http://localhost:5173/admin/`
- **Production:** `https://your-domain.com/admin/`

### Editable Collections

| Collection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Members** | Lab members (PI, current members, alumni) |
| **Publications** | Research papers organized by year |
| **News** | News and event announcements |
| **Lab Info** | Lab description and contact information |

### BibTeX Import

The CMS includes a custom BibTeX widget for batch importing publications with:
- Automatic author name format conversion
- DOI-based link generation
- Preprint detection (arXiv, bioRxiv, ChemRxiv)
- Duplicate detection

### Manual Editing

Edit JSON files directly in `public/data/`. Hard-refresh the browser (Cmd+Shift+R) to see changes during development.

---

## Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) when pushing to the `main` branch.

### Configuration

Build settings are defined in `netlify.toml`:
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist/`
- **SPA routing:** Redirects all routes to `index.html`

### Deploy to Netlify

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start)

Or manually:
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Build settings will be auto-detected from `netlify.toml`
3. Push to main branch to trigger deployment

## Image Management

### Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Recommended Size |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| `public/assets/images/people/` | Team photos | 400×400px |
| `public/assets/images/papers/` | Publication thumbnails | 500×300px |
| `public/assets/images/posts/` | News/blog images | 800×600px+ |

### Naming Conventions

- **People:** `bio-lastname.jpg` (e.g., `bio-chan.jpg`)
- **Papers:** `paperX.jpg` (e.g., `paper1.jpg`)
- **Posts:** `descriptive-name.jpg`

### Optimization

- Format: JPG at 85% quality
- File size: Under 500KB

## Development Notes

- **TypeScript Strict Mode** — Full type checking enabled; build fails on errors
- **Tailwind CSS v4** — Theme customization via `@theme` directive in `src/index.css`
- **Dark Mode** — Class-based toggling with `dark:` prefix
- **Data Caching** — DataLoader caches fetched data; hard-refresh to see JSON changes

For detailed guidelines, see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md).
